In this lab you will configure and verify connected, local, static, summary, load balance, and default routes. You will also examine the effect of longest prefix match routing.
All routers and switches are unconfigured at the start of the lab. The PCs have been configured with their network settings.


Connected and Local Routes

2) Configure hostnames on the routers according to the Lab Topology diagram.
3) Configure IP addresses on R1 according to the Lab Topology diagram
4) Verify routes have been automatically added for the connected and local networks (note that local routes only appear from IOS 15)
5) Do you see routes for all networks that R1 is directly connected to? Why or why not?
6) Should you be able to ping from PC1 to PC2? Verify this (Click on PC1 then Desktop and Command Prompt to access its

Static Routes
9) Configure IP addresses on R2, R3 and R4 according to the Lab Topology diagram. Do not configure the Internet FastEthernet 1/1 interface on R4.
Do not configure R5.
10) Verily PC3 can ping its default gateway at 10.1.2.1
11) Configure static routes on R1. R2, R3 and R4 to allow connectivity between all their subnels. Use /24 prefixes for each network.
12) Verily connectivity between PC1, PC2 and PC3.
13) Verily the path traffic takes from PC1 to PC3


Summary Routes
14) Remove all the statie routes on R1
15) Verify that PC1 loses connectivity to PC3
16) Restore connectivity to all subnets with a single command on R1.
17) Verify the routing table on R1 does not contain /24 routes to remote subnets.
18) Ensure that connectivity is restored between PC1 and PCS.


Longest Prefix Match
19) Configure IP addresses on R5 according to the Lab Topology diagram
20) Do not add any additional routes. Does PC1 have reachability to the FastEthernet 0/0 interface on R5? If so, which path will the traffic take?
21) Ensure reachability over the shortest possible path from R5 to all directly connected networks on R1. Achieve this with a single command.
22) Verify the path traffic takes from PC1 to the FastEthernet 0/0 interface on
23) Verify the path the return traffic takes from R5 to PC1.
24) Ensure that traffic between PC1 and the FastEthernet 0/0 interface on R5
takes the most direct path in both directions.
25) Verify that traffic between PC1 and the FastEthernet O/0 interface on RS
takes the most direct path in both directions.

Default Route and Load Balancing
26) Configure an IP address on the Internet FastEthernet 1/1 interface on R4
according to the lab topology diagram.
27) Ensure that all PCs have a route out to the internet through the Internet.
Service Provider connection on R4. (Note that the lab does not actually have Internet connectivity.)
28) Traffic from PC1 and PC2 going to the internet should be load balanced over R2 and RS.
